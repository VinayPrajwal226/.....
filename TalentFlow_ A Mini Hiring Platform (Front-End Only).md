# TalentFlow: A Mini Hiring Platform (Front-End Only)

This project is a technical assignment to build a single-page, front-end-only application simulating a mini hiring platform. It is built with **React** and **Vite**, utilizing modern front-end practices, advanced state management, and a robust mock API layer for a server-like experience.

## üöÄ Core Features Implemented

The application implements three core modules: Jobs, Candidates, and Assessments, fulfilling all requirements of the technical assignment.

| Module | Core Functionality | Technical Implementation Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Jobs Board** | Create, Edit, Archive, and Reorder job postings. | Server-like pagination, filtering (title, status, tags), and sorting. **Optimistic updates** with rollback on drag-and-drop reordering using `@dnd-kit`. Deep linking to individual job pages (`/jobs/:jobId`). |
| **Candidates** | View, search, and manage candidate progression. | **Virtualized list** for 1000+ seeded candidates for performance. Client-side search (name/email) and server-like filtering (current stage). **Kanban board** (drag-and-drop) for stage transitions. Candidate profile with a status change timeline and note attachment. |
| **Assessments** | Build and administer job-specific quizzes/forms. | Comprehensive **Assessment Builder** with multiple question types (text, choice, numeric, file stub). Live preview of the form. **Form Runtime** with advanced validation and **conditional question logic**. |

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack and Architecture

| Category | Technology | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Framework** | React (v19), Vite | Modern front-end development and fast build tooling. |
| **Styling** | Tailwind CSS | Utility-first CSS framework for rapid and responsive UI development. |
| **Routing** | React Router v6 | Declarative routing for navigation. |
| **Mock API** | **MSW (Mock Service Worker)** | Intercepts network requests to simulate a full REST API, including artificial latency and error rates. |
| **Persistence** | **Dexie (IndexedDB)** | The single source of truth for all application data, ensuring state persistence across page refreshes. MSW handlers implement a "write-through" pattern to Dexie. |
| **Drag & Drop** | `@dnd-kit` | Used for Job reordering (optimistic updates) and Candidate stage movement (Kanban board). |
| **Forms** | `react-hook-form` | Efficient form management and validation. |
| **Data** | `@faker-js/faker` | Used to generate the required 1000+ candidates and seed data. |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v18+)
*   pnpm (or npm/yarn)

### Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    \`\`\`bash
    git clone [YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_LINK]
    cd talent-flow
    \`\`\`

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    \`\`\`bash
    pnpm install
    # or npm install
    \`\`\`

3.  **Run the application:**
    \`\`\`bash
    pnpm run dev
    # or npm run dev
    \`\`\`

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or the port specified by Vite). The initial seed data (25 jobs, 1000+ candidates, 3+ assessments) will be loaded into IndexedDB on the first run.

## üí° Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Data Persistence and Mocking

*   **Decision:** Use **MSW** for the network layer and **Dexie** (IndexedDB) for local persistence.
*   **Justification:** This approach perfectly simulates a real-world application architecture where the client communicates with a server (MSW), but the data is locally persisted (Dexie). The MSW handlers act as the "server-side" logic, implementing the required write-through to IndexedDB, artificial latency (200-1200ms), and a 5-10% error rate on write operations to test resilience and optimistic update rollbacks.

### 2. Optimistic Updates and Error Handling

*   **Decision:** Implement drag-and-drop reordering for Jobs with **optimistic UI updates**.
*   **Justification:** For a better user experience, the UI updates immediately when the user drops a job. If the mock API (MSW) returns a simulated `500` error (5-10% chance), the application executes a **rollback**, reverting the job's position in the UI, demonstrating robust error handling for critical write operations.

### 3. Performance for Large Datasets

*   **Decision:** Employ a **virtualized list** for the Candidates board.
*   **Justification:** The requirement specifies handling 1000+ seeded candidates. Standard rendering would lead to significant performance degradation. Virtualization ensures that only the visible rows are rendered, maintaining a smooth 60fps scrolling experience even with a massive dataset.

### 4. Assessment Builder Logic

*   **Decision:** Use a single, complex state object for the form builder and a recursive rendering component for the form runtime.
*   **Justification:** This allows for dynamic form generation and easy implementation of **conditional question logic** (e.g., show Q3 only if Q1 is 'Yes'). The builder state is directly persisted to IndexedDB, allowing users to leave and return to an in-progress assessment design.

## üêû Known Issues and Future Improvements

### Known Issues

*   **Drag-and-Drop on Mobile:** While functional, the drag handles for reordering jobs and moving Kanban cards could be optimized for a better touch-screen experience.
*   **File Upload Stub:** The file upload question type is currently a UI stub and does not process or store actual file data (as per assignment scope). A future enhancement would be to integrate with a local storage solution like `localForage` for file data.

### Future Improvements

1.  **User Authentication:** Implement a full sign-in/sign-out flow with token management (currently a basic `AuthContext` stub).
2.  **Advanced Filtering:** Add multi-select tag filtering and date range filtering to the Jobs board.
3.  **Real-time Updates:** Integrate a WebSocket layer to simulate real-time updates for candidate stage changes across multiple HR users.
